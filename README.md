# Basic-Information-Storing-using-C--and-File-

This is a simple project on **C++** and storing the football player names in a **File**. The project is made using the **OOPS** concept. You will find **Abstraction, Overloading and other OOPs implementation** in the project.

Please, suggest ideas to make it more advanced or in a easy way.

Thank you.
